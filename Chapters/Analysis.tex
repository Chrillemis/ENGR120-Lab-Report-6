As seen in Table \ref{table:results} it is clear, that $axis = 0$ is the best axis to apply our model from eq. \ref{eq:linfunc} on. This is done in figure \ref{fig:copper}, \ref{fig:galvanized} and \ref{fig:PVC}, from which the unknown flow rates are determined, as described in section \ref{sec_level1}. It is also clear from some of the flow rates, some having very large uncertainties and one even being negative.
