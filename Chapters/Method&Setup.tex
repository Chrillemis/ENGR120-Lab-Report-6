We have a setup of pies consisting of three different materials: Copper, Galvanized Steel and PVC. We control the flow rate through the pipe, and take measurements at five different flow rates: $2, 3, 4, 6 m^3/hr$ and an unknown. For each flow rate, we have an accelerometer hooked up to the pipe, which measures the acceleration in 3 different directions $(x, y, z)$ for 30 seconds, and we take the mean of each. We then f
