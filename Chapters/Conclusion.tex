In conclusion, we have effectively estimated flowrate throguh different pipes, obtaining the values $(5.3\pm 3.3)m^3/hr$ for Copper, $(4.3\pm 2.9)m^3/hr$ for galvanized steel and $(6.2\pm 1.0)m^3/hr$ for PVC. The uncertainties obtained are quite large, although depending on your application it may not be of issue. They can also be mitigated by obtaining more data ore training a more complex model.
