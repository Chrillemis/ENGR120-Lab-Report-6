First, we look at the Venturi meter. It consists of a circular pipe, with a given volume flow rate. At a section of the pipe, where it conically shrinks shortly, we measure the pressure at three different points, see fig \ref{fig:Venturi}. The Orifice meter is almost identical to the Venturi meter, although there is no conical shrinkring, but a \textit{wall} with a small hole in the middle of diameter $d$, see fig \ref{fig:Orifice}.
