We observe that the data deviates a lot from the ideal values in Figure \ref{fig:pvVsQ}. This is likely due to the fact that we do not account for friction and viscous forces.

From \ref{fig:hf2VsQ} it is very clear that $h_{f2}$ is quadratically dependent on $Q$, which is why we in figure \ref{fig:hf1Vshf2} observe that $h_{f1}$ and $h_{f2}$ are very correlated, almost following a straight line. This is due to the fact that they are both functions of $Q^2$.
